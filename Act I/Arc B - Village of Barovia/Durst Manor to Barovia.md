## B3. Svalich Woods
[This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area C](/module/cos/page/the-lands-of-barovia-AreasofBaroviaAI/#CSvalichWoods)

This scene begins as described in [Svalich Woods (p. 34)](/module/cos/page/the-lands-of-barovia-AreasofBaroviaAI/#CSvalichWoods). 

>Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream. {.read}

If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, they can continue on to the village of Barovia (area E) without incident.{.read}

If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

You catch the scent of death on the air.
The character can follow the stench to its source:

>The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes appear to have been torn by brambles and thorns. Crows have been at the body. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds an old, tarnished copper compass in one hand.{.read}

However, when the players find the corpse of Dalvan Olensky, he is not holding a crumpled envelope, and his clothes appear to have been torn by brambles and thorns, rather than claw marks. He doesn't appear to have any visible wounds, 
>A successful [DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check](/roll/1d20) reveals that he died of exhaustion.{.orange}

Instead of the envelope, Dalvan is now holding an old, tarnished copper compass. While it remains close to the edge of the Barovian valley, its needle trembles strangely even when held still.

>Dalvan's hand holding the compass is splayed out in the direction of a nearby tree, which bears thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points deeper into the woods, along what seems to be a well-traveled footpath.{.yellow}


> **LORE -- What Happened to Dalvan?**
>
> In the wake of Strahd's attack on the village of Barovia, one of the survivors—a young man named Dalvan Olensky—was overcome with terror and despair.
>
> Determined to find a way free from Barovia, Dalvan traveled to the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool, seeking out the reputed Vistani seer Madam Eva. There, Madam Eva read his future in the Tarokka cards, and drew the Horseman—a card that predicted that he would die in the Barovian valley.
>
> Panicked, Dalvan returned to the village of Barovia under cover of night, stole a horse and compass, and set off for the eastern road out of Barovia. When the Svalich Road seemed to end, Dalvan delved into the woods, crossing through the mist and reemerging on the opposite side of the road.
>
> A terrified, desperate, and delirious Dalvan repeated the loop thirteen times, his stolen horse expiring of exhaustion halfway through. It wasn't long before Dalvan succumbed to the effects of the Barovian fog as well—though not before inscribing his own epitaph in the form of the carving on the fourth tree.
>
> Madam Eva regrets Dalvan's fate—but as the avatar of the Seeker, she is bound to read the future when asked, and knows that no efforts to escape can unravel a future that she has foreseen.{.blue}

>**INFO -- Dalvan's Compass**
>Like all compasses in Barovia, Dalvan's compass behaves strangely as it approaches the vicinity of the edge of the Barovian valley—such as by Yester Hill in [Arc K - The Stolen Gem] or toward the peak of Mount Ghakis in [Arc T - The Amber Temple]. Because there is no true "magnetic north" beyond the Mists that encircle Barovia, the needle of a compass that approaches the edge of the valley begins to tremble and eventually spin wildly the closer it gets. (This strange behavior ends when the compass is removed from the edge of the valley.){.grey}

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they soon come to a second tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. The edge of the footpath here bears the corpse of a **horse**, which is in a similar state of decay to Dalvan's.

If the players continue to follow the footpath in the direction of the arrows, they come to a third tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath, which visibly vanishes into a wall of impenetrable fog.

The fog is part of the Mists that surround and entrap Barovia. If the players brought Dalvan's compass with them, the needle is now spinning wildly in circles.

If the players follow the footpath through the fog, they emerge after [2d4](/roll/2d4) minutes in an unfamiliar portion of the Svalich Woods. Each time the players emerge from the wall of fog around Barovia, they must make a 
>DC 5 Constitution saving throw or take 1 level of exhaustion, as the fog saps their energy and drains their life force. (The DC increases by 5 each time that the players pass through the fog again.){.orange}

Upon emerging from the fog, the players can see a fourth tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks an an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. In addition, the fourth tree appears to bear a carving and has an object protruding from its trunk. If the players inspect it, read:

>Someone has stabbed an old dagger in the trunk of this old, gnarled tree. Beside it lies a rough carving of a figure atop a horse, just above two sets of rough-hewn words:
>
>THE HORSEMAN RIDES
>
>THE SEER SPOKE TRUE{.read}

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they find that it crosses the Svalich Road before returning to the location of Dalvan's corpse. 

If the players then leave Dalvan's corpse and return, they find that both his and the horse's remains have vanished.

## B4. Barovian Overlook
[This scene takes place in Chapter 2: Area D.](/module/cos/page/the-lands-of-barovia-AreasofBaroviaAI/#DRiverIvlis))

The players emerge from the Svalich Woods one mile and twenty minutes after departing Dalvan's corpse. When they do, read:

>The dark woods fall away, revealing a misted, gloomy valley dotted with thick clouds of fog.
>
>Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land below, no sun visible in the cold, grey light. Evergreen trees climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. To the north rises a stony mount with tufts of trees; to the south, a snow-capped peak with rugged slopes towers imperiously above the land below.
>
>The muddy road continues on ahead, passing through yellowed grasses and farmland until it reaches a small, humble settlement hunkered down in the earth. Alongside the road, a river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.
>
>Far above the village looms a dark, twisted castle, standing alone atop a pillar of sheer stone. For an instant, a distant spear of lightning crackles, illuminating the towering keep in harsh lights and shadows—and then a thick bank of fog rolls in, concealing the village and castle from view.{.read}

The journey from here to the outskirts of the village is two miles long and takes forty minutes.
